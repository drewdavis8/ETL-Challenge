## Overview

Our team has been approached by investors to determine a location for a successful cannibis dispensory. 
Out of 34 states and territories that have legalized and/or decriminalized cannibis, we have narrowed down to Massachusetts, California, and Colorado. 

These states have been determined by a few factors:

* Overall sales (Dept. of Treasury), taxable revenue within each state that have legalized cannibis (recreational and medical), and population within or around neighboring states (US Census).
* By scrubbing, analyzing, and delivering the data, we will be able to determine which state of the three listed above will allow our investors to determine where to locate their dispensory to maximize profits.

## Datasets

* Cannabis Control Commision of Massachusetts - https://opendata.mass-cannabis-control.com/Industry-and-Products/Public-View-Facility-Activity-Daily-Totals/j3q7-3usu/data
* California Department of Tax and Fee - https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/dataportal/dataset.htm?url=CannabisTaxRevenues

* U.S Census Bureau - https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2020/state/totals/

## Approach

Using each dataset, we will aggregate columns to a common granularity, remove unneeded columns from each, and ensure datatype are defined correctly.
